% Our goal is to setup a framework to solve PDEs in many contexts.

% This is a short description of the course. It should give a little flavour of what the course is about, and what will be roughly covered in the notes.

This article constitutes my notes for the `Methods' course, held in Michaelmas 2021 at Cambridge. These notes are \emph{not a transcription of the lectures}, and differ significantly in quite a few areas. Still, all lectured material should be covered.

\section{Straight Into Content} 


We care a significant amount about $X$ random object.

\begin{definition}[Random Object]
    We say that an object $X$ is a \vocab{random object} if we literally do not care about what it actually is.
\end{definition}

It is trivial to check that all objects you will meet in this course are random objects.
