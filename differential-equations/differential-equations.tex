	{\color{red} None of the notes here have been reviewed at all, and are just exactly what was taken down live in the lectures. I would turn around now and come back in a few days, when I have gone back, cleaned things up, fixed explanations and added some structure.}
	\vspace{5\baselineskip}

	This set of notes is a work-in-progress account of the course `Differential Equations', originally lectured by Dr. John Taylor in Michaelmas 2020 at Cambridge. These notes are not a transcription of the lectures, but they do roughly follow what was lectured (in content and in structure).

	These notes are my own view of what was taught, and should be somewhat of a superset of what was actually taught. I frequently provide different explanations, proofs, examples, and so on in areas where I feel they are helpful. Because of this, this work is likely to contain errors, which you may assume are my own. If you spot any or have any other feedback, I can be contacted at \href{mailto:ak2316@cam.ac.uk}{ak2316@cam.ac.uk}.

	% During the creation of this document, I consulted a number of other books and resources. All of these are listed in the bibliography.

\section{Calculus}

\subsection{Derivatives and Limits}

We will consider limits in an informal capacity.

\begin{definition}[Limits]
	We say that the \vocab{limit} $\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = A$ if $f(x)$ can be made arbitrarily close $A$ by making $x$ sufficiently close to $x_0$.
\end{definition}

We can define limits from two side:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Left Limits}. $\lim_{x \to x_0^-} f(x) = A$, requiring $x < x_0$.
	\item \emph{Right Limits}. $\lim_{x \to x_0^+} f(x) = A$, requiring $x > x_0$.
\end{itemize}

Using the definition of a limit, we can define what a \emph{derivative} is.

\begin{definition}[Derivatives]
	We define the \vocab{derivative} of a function $f(x)$ with respect to it's argument $x$ to be the function
	$$
	\frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.
	$$
\end{definition}

\emph{Pictorially}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{derivative.jpg}
\end{center}

For the derivative to exist at a point $x$, we require
$$
\lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}.
$$

\begin{example}
	The function $f(x) = |x|$ is not differentiable at $x = 0$, but it is everywhere else.
\end{example}

There are a number of ways of writing derivatives.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Leibniz Notation}. $\frac{df}{dx}$
	\item \emph{Lagrange Notation}. $f'(x)$
	\item \emph{Newton Notation}. $\dot{f}(x)$ -- This is typically only used for the derivative with respect to time.
\end{itemize}


For sufficiently smooth functions (the derivative exists at each step), we can define `higher order derivatives' recursively.

\begin{definition}[Higher-Order Derivatives]
	We define the notion of higher order derivatives recursively with
	$$
	\frac{d^0 f}{dx^0} = f \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{d^n f}{dx^n}\right) = \frac{d^{n + 1} f}{dx^{n + 1}}.
	$$
	In Lagrange notation, we write $\frac{d^n f}{dx^n} = f^{(n)}(x)$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Rules for Differentiation}

In this section, we review some rules for computing derivatives that should be familiar to you. These can be proven directly from the definitions.

\begin{theorem}[The Chain Rule]
	Consider $f(x) = F(g(x))$. Then
	$$
	f'(x) = F'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) = \frac{dF}{dg} \cdot \frac{dg}{dx}.
	$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[The Product Rule]
	Consider $f(x) = u(x) v(x)$. Then
	$$
	\frac{df}{dx} = u'(x) v(x) + u(x) v'(x).
	$$
\end{theorem}

We can generalise the product rule to higher order derivatives. The generalisation bears a large resemblance to the binomial theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Leibniz Rule]
	Consider $f(x) = u(x) v(x)$. Then
	$$
f^{(n)}(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} u^{(k)}(x) v^{(n - k)} (x).
	$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
	Induction on $n$.
\end{proof}

For example, for $n = 3$ we have
$$
f'''(x) = u'''v + 3 u'' v' + 3 u' v'' + u v'''.
$$
