\begin{abstract}
	This document is an account of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos course `Groups', lectured by Dr. Ana Khukhro. in Michaelmas 2020.
	This is a work in progress, and is likely to to contain errors, which you may assume to be my own.
	% This document is a rather brief summary of the first three chapters of H. S. M. Coxeter and S. L. Greitzer's `Geometry Revisited'.
	% In no ways is this fleshed out, and in most cases just contains the important results and diagrams.
	% Specifically, it's purpose is to be somewhat of a reference which one can consult whilst attempting olympiad geometry problems.

\section{Groups}

`Groups' is a course which introduces you to the subject of \emph{Abstract Algebra}.
Indeed, while groups are one of the simplest and most basic of all the algebraic structures\footnote{Apart from `magmas' I suppose, but they don't tend to be a particularly useful notion.}, they are immensely useful and appear in almost every area of mathematics. 

\subsection{Definition of a Group}

We will begin our study of the subject by defining formally what a group is.

\begin{definition}[Group]
	A \vocab{group} is a set $G$ with a binary operation\footnote{Some texts include an additional \emph{closure} axiom, but this is implied by $*$ being a binary operation on $G$.} $*$ which satisfies the axioms:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Identity}. There is an element $e \in G$ such that $g * e = e * g = g$ for every $g \in G$.
		\item \emph{Inverses}. For every element $g \in G$, there is an element $g^{-1} \in G$ such that $g * g^{-1} = g^{-1} * g = e$.
		\item \emph{Associativity}. The operation $*$ is associative.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We typically refer to a group as defined above by $(G, *)$, which explicitly states that $*$ is the group operation. When the operation being used is clear, we can refer to the group by just $G$. We will also be omitting the group's operation symbol quite often, for example writing $gh = g * h$. 

 In the next section, we will look at some non-trivial examples of groups.

\subsection{Elementary Properties of Groups}

With the notion of a group now defined, we can now consider some basic facts that follow directly from the definition of a group. We will first address whether it is possible for a group to have multiple identity elements, or for an element to have multiple inverses (no).

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness of the Identity and Inverse]
	Let $(G, *)$ be a group. Then there is a unique identity element, and for every $g \in G$, $g^{-1}$ is unique.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	To prove that the identity element is unique, let $e$ and $e'$ be identity elements of $G$. Then $e* e' = e$ and $e* e' = e'$ by definition, giving $e = e'$. 
	
	To prove that the inverses are unique, suppose that for some $g, h, k \in G$ we have $g* h = g *k = e$. Then $g^{-1}* g *h = g^{-1} *g * k$, implying $h = k$. The case of $h * g = k * g = e$ follows analogously.
\end{proof}

The next useful fact is the \emph{cancellation law}, whose proof bears a large resemblance to the proof that inverses are unique.

\begin{proposition}[Cancellation Law]
	If $(G, *)$ is a group, and $a, b, c \in G$, then $a*b = a*c$ and $b*a = c*a$ both imply $b = c$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Taking $a * b = a * c$ and left-multiplying by $a^{-1}$ we have $a^{-1} * a * b = a^{-1} * a * c$, that is, $b = c$. The other case follows analogously.
\end{proof}

The last proposition we will prove in this section gives us a useful result about computing inverses.

\begin{proposition}[Computing Inverses]
	Let $(G, *)$ be a group, and let $g, h \in G$. Then the following hold:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item $(g*h)^{-1} = h^{-1} * g^{-1}$.
		\item $(g^{-1})^{-1} = g$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}$ $\phantom{\qedhere}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item We have $(g*h) * (h^{-1} * g^{-1}) =  g * (h * h^{-1}) * g^{-1} = g * g^{-1} = e$, so $(g*h)^{-1} = h^{-1} * g^{-1}$.
		\item Similarly, $g^{-1} * g = e$, so $(g^{-1})^{-1} = g$. \hfill \qedsymbol
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}


\end{document}
