\begin{abstract}

	This set of notes is a work-in-progress account of the course `Vectors and Matrices', originally lectured by Dr. Jonathan Evans in Michaelmas 2020 at Cambridge. These notes are not a transcription of the lectures, but they do roughly follow what was lectured (in content and in structure).

	These notes are my own view of what was taught, and should be somewhat of a superset of what was actually taught. I frequently provide different explanations, proofs, examples, and so on in areas where I feel they are helpful. Because of this, this work is likely to contain errors, which you may assume are my own. If you spot any or have any other feedback, I can be contacted at \href{mailto:ak2316@cam.ac.uk}{ak2316@cam.ac.uk}.
