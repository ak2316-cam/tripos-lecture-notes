Quantum mechanics is the mathematical framework used to describe nature at the scale of subatomic particles. This course will primarily focus on building up this mathematical framework, and not so much on the actual applications or physical background to it.

% This is a short description of the course. It should give a little flavour of what the course is about, and what will be roughly covered in the notes.

This article constitutes my notes for the `Quantum Mechanics' course, held in Michaelmas 2021 at Cambridge. These notes are \emph{not a transcription of the lectures}, and differ significantly in quite a few areas. Still, all lectured material should be covered.

% \subsection{Particles and Waves in Classical Mechanics}

% We will begin by describing the physical background to particles and waves, as studied in classical mechanics.

% % \begin{definition}[Particle]
    
% % \end{definition}

% A \vocab{particle} is an object carrying energy and momentum in an point-like position in space.
% Particles are determined by two vectors, $\vv x$ (position) and $\vv v = \vv{\dot{x}}$ (velocity). Newton's second law gave us that
% $$
%     m \ddot{\vv x} = \vv{F}(\vv{x}(t), \vv{\dot{x}}(t)),
% $$
% and solving this equation would then describe the position totally, so long as the initial conditions are known.

% A \vocab{wave} is any real or complex valued function with periodicity in time and/or space. If the period of the wave is $T$, then it has frequency $1/T$, and we define the \vocab{angular frequency} as $\omega = 2 \pi / T$. If we have a function of $x$ in one dimension, $f(x + \lambda) = f(x)$, we call $\lambda$ the \vocab{wavelength} and $k = 2\pi/\lambda$ the \vocab{wavenumber}.
% In three dimensions, we have $f(x) = \exp(i \vv k \cdot \vv x)$, which we call \vocab{plane waves}. We call $\vv k$ the \vocab{wavevector}, and $\lambda = 2\pi/|\vv k|$.

% One dimensional waves obey the wave equation
% $$
%     \frac{\partial^2 f(x, t)}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 f(x, t)}{\partial x^2} = 0,
% $$
% with $c \in \R$. The solutions are given by
% $$
%     f(x, t) = A \exp(\pm i kx - i \omega t), 
% $$
% with $\omega = ck$ and $\lambda = cT$ (the dispersion relations). We call $A$ the amplitude.

% The three dimensional wave equation is given by
% $$
% \frac{\partial^2 f(\vv x, t)}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 f(\vv x, t) = 0,
% $$
% and the solutions are given by
% $$
% f(\vv x, t) = A \exp(i \vv k \cdot \vv x - i \omega t),
% $$
% with $\omega = c |\vv k|$ and $\lambda = cT$.

% Other kinds of waves arise as solutions to other governing wave equations, provided other dispersion relations are given.
% Also for any governing equation that is linear in $f$, we always have the superposition principle, saying that if $f_1, f_2$ are solutions to the equation, then so is $f = f_1 + f_2$.

% % \subsection{Particle-like Behavior of Light-waves}

% % % Blackbody radiation

% \subsection{Particle-Like Behavior of Light-Waves}

% If you heat a body to a temperature $T$, it will emit radiation.
% The simplest system which this behavior can be studied in is a \emph{black-body}, a totally absorbing surface. In studying such a system, Kirchoff looked at the intensity of light emitted by the black body as a function of the radiation frequency. He observed a %insertimagehere



\section{Foundations of Quantum Mechanics}

\subsection{Wavefunctions and Probabilistic Interpretation}

How do we describe a point particle? 
In classical mechanics, we had a vector $\vv x$ and a vector $\vv p$ which gave the position and momentum of the particle. 

The corresponding description in quantum mechanics is the state $\psi$, described\footnote{The state $\psi$ should be thought of as an abstract entity, with the wavefunction $\psi(\vv x, t)$ being the complex coefficients of $\psi$ in a continuous basis.} of  by the complex valued \emph{wavefunction} $\psi(\vv x, t)$. 

\begin{definition}[Wavefunction]
    A \vocab{wavefunction} $\psi(\vv x, t)$ is a complex valued function $\R^3 \times \R \rightarrow \C$ that satisfies the mathematical properties dictated by its physical interpretation.
\end{definition}

To see how the wavefunction related to the underlying physical object, we need to have some sort of interpretation of it. This is given by the \emph{Born rule}.

\begin{law}[The Born Rule]
The probability density for a particle to be at $\vv x$ at a time $t$ is given by
$$
\rho(\vv x, t) = \abs{\psi(\vv x, t)}^2.
$$
\end{law}

The Born rule immediately imposes some restrictions on the wavefunction. Because the particle has to be \emph{somewhere} with probability 1, the wavefunction has normalized such that 
$$
    \int_{\R^3} \abs{\psi(\vv x, t)}^2 \dd V = 1.
$$

It's sometimes useful to work with unnormalized wavefunctions (where we just impose the restriction that this integral is finite), but it must be remembered that the underlying physical interpretation requires this to be normalized.
